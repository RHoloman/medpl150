  <h2>Week 1 Reflection</h2>
<p> This week’s assignment was my introduction to coding.  I’ve taken a web design class many years ago, but even that course never went into the intricacies of what the code looks like.  Building the html file was the easiest part, but putting together the code chain–while altogether straightforward–was definitely as nerve racking as I thought it’d be.  Trying to type paragraphs on a single straight line was a nuisance, to the point where I just typed my paragraphs on a separate document and pasted them in in order to make things easier.  Once I got the sense of the chain for the title, header and body, it went rather smoothly.  The hardest part was definitely adding the picture.  I thought I had to add the photo to the code file, which didn’t work.  Then I tried adding the title of the photo to no avail.  It wasn’t until I checked the professor’s email where I understood I had to add the images file as a whole and type in the link.  I would love to get more knowledge on how to build a website in order to build my own from the ground up.</p>

    <h3><p>Possibly my most successful photo this week after the one used for the camera raw filter.  The bottle itself was clear, yet the background was blurred just enough as to not distract from it.  Maybe it's due to the fact that I had the camera focus on a single object made the contrast better.</p></h3>

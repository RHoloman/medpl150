    <h3><p> There are many ways media can be used to convey a narrative.  Mixing media like illustration, photography, audio and video can help make a narrative more engaging and interactive, with each adding a different effect to the final piece.  This is what makes the virtual graphic novels for Motherhood In Crisis as effective as they are for both narrative and conveying a message. Graphic novels by themselves are incredible vessels for storytelling, so to illustrate different women’s stories and incorporate real photos of locations and people with accompanying video interviews of the doctors drives home the importance of the need for women’s care, especially for those who are pregnant or victims of sexual assault who become pregnant.</p></h3>
    <h3><p> While all the stories are heartwrenching, Kadiatu’s story was especially sad.  She gained a negative reputation after losing five of her children, each of them dying to health complications at very young ages, with one even being stillborn.  Instead of medical treatment, however, they had a village “healer” who said that some diseases were merely “signs of the devil” and to pray away the pain.  This is what led to people in her own community to view her as “cursed by the devil” because of their false superstitions.  In actuality, they had easily treatable diseases but no access to healthcare facilities as they would need to take a long car ride to get to the nearest hospital.  Kadiatu didn’t ever go to a hospital until she had to give birth to her latest child.  She took her eldest living child to the same hospital after he started seizing and the village healer once again said the boy was “possessed by the devil”.”  She got her son treated thankfully, and is living healthy with both of her surviving children.</p></h3>
    <h3><p> Illustration helped convey the pain and the isolation that Kadiatu was feeling in a way that traditional photography can’t always capture.  While techniques like composition, lighting and color are used, how they are implemented lets them be more active in portraying the narrative.  Having some of the images be a pseudo collage by having actual photos being drawn over with lines (and possibly using image tracing in Illustrator to blend more with the illustration style) makes the stories feel authentic, transporting the viewer to Sierra Leone.</p></h3>
    <h3><p> Having these stories be shown rather than read lets the reader digest and internalize them in a more direct way.  While text can be engaging in its own way with the right use of literary techniques, adding illustrative elements or making illustration be the vessel through which the story is told can possibly enhance what’s already written.  In the end, a graphic novel is only as good as its narrative.  Without these women’s stories, it would be very difficult to portray the message that they set out to make.  These stories would still be harrowing to read, but seeing their expressions and emotions makes them more tangible.  Yet in the same, without the pictures of these women and where they come from, it could be tasking for even the writer to make a compelling story.  Using multimedia made the projects all the more striking and engaging, and the stories and their mission was executed with great detail and a fascinating way to make graphic novels more interactive in the digital age. </p></h3>

  <title>Prompt: Reflect on Photography + Photoshop Basics</title>

  <h3>
   <p>  It’s been a long time since I’ve tried using a DSLR camera.  I knew I wanted to try doing things manually with the camera as much as possible to limit how much editing I’d have to do in Photoshop.  That being said, it was pretty challenging to get the right settings for the shots I wanted to take, but once I got used to how to tweak the settings, I had a lot of fun. </p>
   <p>  As for the pictures themselves, I knew I wanted to focus more on candid photography of the building.  Since most people were in class, the halls were mostly empty, so the setting and ambiance was perfect timing as I usually try to avoid taking pictures of others, which has caused some internal conflict as to whether or not these were just abstracted landscapes rather than candid photography.  </p>
   <p>  For Photoshop, I did run into some confusion with how to compose the images.  Originally, I just cropped the images to match the original photo composition and set the canvases on landscape.  Once I read the assignment again, I got a bit concerned, so I made new canvases set to the requested portrait sizes and cropped the images in that way.  I had already made level and curve adjustments to the images I chose and made new jpeg files prior to adding them to the new canvases, so it was only a matter of fitting the photos in a new frame.  The curves and levels are fun, but tricky as it’s easy to get a bit carried away with the tonal composition and contrast.  The hardest part was actually making the site links and adjustments…</p>

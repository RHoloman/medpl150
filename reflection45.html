  <title>Week 4&5 Reflection: Photomontage</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h3><p> I have a small confession to make; I am not the biggest fan of using Photoshop and I particularly like doing vector work.  I was introduced to Adobe Illustrator about ten years ago and it has been one of the banes of my creative existence.  It’s an amazing program for art making, but when I first thought of Illustrator, I thought there would be more for raster-like painting like in Photoshop or Clip Studio Paint, which I use predominately for my digital work.  The vector process of shape and numbers felt overly complicated coming from a more “traditional” background in art. </p></h3>
    <h3><p> Needless to say, the vector process went by fairly smoothly this time around.  I believe doing the regular photomontage first really helped us warm up to using paths and masks, and that translated in Illustrator pretty well when I was making the shapes I wanted.  Tracing the glacier and making the stars and stripes of the American flag went by fairly quickly.  Getting Pathfinder to work was a challenge, but I eventually figured it out. </p></h3>
    <h3><p> As for the topic of my piece, I chose to make a commentary on ICE and its oppressive nature in this country.  Racism and division has always been an overwhelming force in the United States, so much so that other issues get lost and drowns under the iceberg.  In the ocean underneath the iceberg, you can see images from different school shootings, mainly images from Columbine (which were some of the only ones I found on Wikicommons. In a way, it works with my message as it shows how long this specific issue has been put aside for American Exceptionalism.</p></h3>

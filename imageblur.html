  <h3><p>I used the path tool to select the negative space + a few of the distant buildings to create a sense of depth.  I didn't know how to selct images like how it was shown in lab, so I manually created path shapes and converted them to selections.  I tried this a couple of times to get the blur effect I was looking for.</p>

    <h3><p> I chose this photo because of the windows as a framing device.   It made the landscape shot more interesting, adding this force that helps add some depth to the piece.  It is why it's one of my favorite photos that I've taken this semester.  The colors came a bit more naturally.  I knew I wanted to do something with the primary colors whether for screen or traditional. CMY gave the illustration this graphic, pop art feel that I really liked.  One it had my layers in order, though, placing the colors was pretty difficult to figure out.  I eventually thought of manipulating the values a bit more, and using gradients to add more cohesion and bring all together. </p></h3>

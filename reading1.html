    <p>    When I was younger, my mom and older brother took some photography classes as a means of bonding, as well as to build skills with using DSLR cameras.  While I appreciated photography for its ability to capture moments in time as momentos like family portraits, it was hard for me to see them as vessels to make or capture art.  In fact, because photography has become so prevalent and dominant in modern society, it has turned into something mundane.  Reading In Plato’s Cave helped me realize that that feeling of indifference is something of an inevitability not only for me, but people today especially with the integrity of photography as a whole is in jeopardy with the rampant use of photo editing and images generated with artificial intelligence, or generative AI.</p>
    <p>    In Susan Sontag’s piece, they state that photography “like every mass art form,... is not practiced by people as an art.” (page 8)  This encapsulated what my dilemma was with photography.  Like games and architecture, photography has become apart of our daily routine, whether as a viewer or photographer.  Nearly every modern cell phone or smartphone has a built-in camera, eliminating the need to carry around a disposable Kodak camera let alone a DSLR or film camera.  Platforms like Instagram, X and Facebook make it so you can omit the process of developing film in a darkroom or printing shots.  Even the act of editing a photograph has lost some of its artistic luster as those same aforementioned platforms and smartphone apps have built in filters and correctors so the everyday person doesn’t have to buy and use Photoshop or learn how to manually adjust aperture or exposure.</p>
    <p>    I would argue that this isn’t necessarily a bad change, rather one that is welcome.  In the statement after the earlier quote, Sontag states that photography “is mainly a social rite, a defense against anxiety, and a tool of power.” (page 8)  Next to the radio, photography has been one of the best and most integral parts that form media today.  Many historical figures and events since the late 1800s have been photographed.  This worked for mass media, as it was a more compelling way to deliver news and breaking stories to a large audience. While already in motion, the civil rights movement would not have gotten as widespread as it did without the picture taken of the brutalized corpse of Emmett Till in his casket.  This of course means that anyone can weaponize photography, however, as we’ve seen it increasingly being used for propaganda and skewing narratives.  While President Trump was out of public sight for health concerns in late August of this year, pictures of him smiling and golfing were uploaded while he was allegedly hospitalized.  People on social media quickly realized that the images the President and his cohorts shared were taken days and even months prior to what they posted, causing more confusion about his condition until he made his first public appearance a couple of days later.</p>
    <p>    While photography has become mundane, it does not mean that it isn’t effective as an art form today.  One of my favorite forms of photography is candid photography.  Candid photography can turn an everyday occurrence interesting.  I took pictures of the hallways and doors in Hunter, things that we go through or see often, and by taking them at an obscure angle and adjusting the exposure and the ISO, the normal empty hallway turned into these eerie scenes.  As photography has become an everyday tool, using it to turn circadian moments and objects into artistic and compositional tools feels like a full-circle action.</p>

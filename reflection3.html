      <h2><b>Reflection</b></h2>
      <p>For the sake of time, I stuck to the same format of candid photography to try out depth of field.  While I understood the concept of the functions, it was pretty difficult to get the right settings for the shots I was trying to make, whether it be how I set up the camera or if there were any limitations with the camera <i> (I tend to believe it was more so the former). </i>  As a result, some of my photos came out more blurry than  I intended.  Luckily, I did have a few shots that worked as intended, with one I used not only to test the camera raw filter, but to do the artificial blur as well.</p>

      <h2><b>Reflection</b></h2>
      <h3><p>For the sake of time, I stuck to the same format of candid photography to try out depth of field.  While I understood the concept of the functions, it was pretty difficult to get the right settings for the shots I was trying to make, whether it be how I set up the camera or if there were any limitations with the camera <i> (I tend to believe it was more so the former). </i>  As a result, some of my photos came out more blurry than  I intended.  Luckily, I did have a few shots that worked as intended, with one I used not only to test the camera raw filter, but to do the artificial blur as well.</p></h3>
      <h3><p>Artificially adding the field blur to the image was also a bit tedious as I had to manually select the areas I wanted to blur.  I did this by using the path tool to block and the shape of the area, then I converted that shape into a selection.  It had to do that a couple of times since Some edges were blurred at all, making the artificial blur more noticeable.  In the end, I agree with Professor Oh’s sentiment as artificial blur adds this unnatural feeling to the image, giving this smudged effect <i> (most likely because I overdid it). </i>  </p></h3>
      <h3><p>Overall, while tedious, it was good practice to manually get a shallow depth of field from the camera itself, and I can see myself translating what I learned from path selection into my digital art making process.  If you’re reading this, the coding was a success…</p></h3>

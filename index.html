    <h1>Rhamsys Holoman's MEDPL 150 Portfolio</h1>
    <h2>Creative Statement</h2>
    <p>  I want to explore how to bring characters from canvas and text to the more interactive world of media.  As a studio art major, I wanted to hone and sharpen my creative expression through traditional mediums and methods, like drawing and painting, in order to better understand how to translate my creative expression digitally and through different forms of media.  I've always been heavily inspired by music, anime like Sailor Moon and games like the Street Fighter, Tekken and Soulcalibur series. </p>
    <p>  For this class, I want to explore different ways to express myself through different forms of media.  While I am versed with some Adobe apps like Photoshop, I’ve only ever used them as tools to complete and finalize artwork and photographs, so I would love to explore different ways to use the app effectively and find new methods of making art.  I aim to improve in Illustrator as well, as I’m interested in getting more familiar with vector art, especially as a means of exploring graphic design, since I’m a bit more versed with raster illustration through programs like Clip Studio Paint.  </p>
    <p>  Ultimately, I aim to be a Character Artist for games and animation.  I hope that with the experience I gain from this class, as well as the skills I gained through traditional forms of art making, can give me a good foundation to build off of to create a good portfolio and new perspective on the creative process.</p>
    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>  This week’s assignment was my introduction to coding.  I’ve taken a web design class many years ago, but even that course never went into the intricacies of what the code looks like.  Building the html file was the easiest part, but putting together the code chain–while altogether straightforward–was definitely as nerveracking as I thought it’d be.  Trying to type paragraphs on a single straight line was a nuance, to the point where I just typed my paragraphs on a separate document and pasted them in in order to make things easier.  Once I got the sense of the chain for the title, header and body, it went rather smoothly.  The hardest part was definitely adding the picture.  I thought I had to add the photo to the code file, which didn’t work.  Then I tried adding the title of the photo to no avail.  It wasn’t until I checked the professor’s email where I understood I had to add the images file as a whole and type in the link.  I would love to get more knowledge on how to build a website in order to build my own from the ground up.</p>

    <p>    When I was younger, my mom and older brother took some photography classes as a means of bonding, as well as to build skills with using DSLR cameras.  While I appreciated photography for its ability to capture moments in time as momentos like family portraits, it was hard for me to see them as vessels to make or capture art.  In fact, because photography has become so prevalent and dominant in modern society, it has turned into something mundane.  Reading In Plato’s Cave helped me realize that that feeling of indifference is something of an inevitability not only for me, but people today especially with the integrity of photography as a whole is in jeopardy with the rampant use of photo editing and images generated with artificial intelligence, or generative AI.</p>
    <p>    In Susan Sontag’s piece, they state that photography “like every mass art form,... is not practiced by people as an art.” (page 8)  This encapsulated what my dilemma was with photography.  Like games and architecture, photography has become apart of our daily routine, whether as a viewer or photographer.  Nearly every modern cell phone or smartphone has a built-in camera, eliminating the need to carry around a disposable Kodak camera let alone a DSLR or film camera.  Platforms like Instagram, X and Facebook make it so you can omit the process of developing film in a darkroom or printing shots.  Even the act of editing a photograph has lost some of its artistic luster as those same aforementioned platforms and smartphone apps have built in filters and correctors so the everyday person doesn’t have to buy and use Photoshop or learn how to manually adjust aperture or exposure.</p>  
    <p>    I would argue that this isn’t necessarily a bad change, rather one that is welcome.  In the statement after the earlier quote, Sontag states that photography “is mainly a social rite, a defense against anxiety, and a tool of power.” (page 8)  Next to the radio, photography has been one of the best and most integral parts that form media today.  Many historical figures and events since the late 1800s have been photographed.  This worked for mass media, as it was a more compelling way to deliver news and breaking stories to a large audience. While already in motion, the civil rights movement would not have gotten as widespread as it did without the picture taken of the brutalized corpse of Emmett Till in his casket.  This of course means that anyone can weaponize photography, however, as we’ve seen it increasingly being used for propaganda and skewing narratives.  While President Trump was out of public sight for health concerns in late August of this year, pictures of him smiling and golfing were uploaded while he was allegedly hospitalized.  People on social media quickly realized that the images the President and his cohorts shared were taken days and even months prior to what they posted, causing more confusion about his condition until he made his first public appearance a couple of days later.</p>
    <p>    While photography has become mundane, it does not mean that it isn’t effective as an art form today.  One of my favorite forms of photography is candid photography.  Candid photography can turn an everyday occurrence interesting.  I took pictures of the hallways and doors in Hunter, things that we go through or see often, and by taking them at an obscure angle and adjusting the exposure and the ISO, the normal empty hallway turned into these eerie scenes.  As photography has become an everyday tool, using it to turn circadian moments and objects into artistic and compositional tools feels like a full-circle action.</p>

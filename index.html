    <h1>Rhamsys Holoman's MEDPL 150 Portfolio</h1>
    <h2>Creative Statement</h2>
    <p>  I want to explore how to bring characters from canvas and text to the more interactive world of media.  As a studio art major, I wanted to hone and sharpen my creative expression through traditional mediums and methods, like drawing and painting, in order to better understand how to translate my creative expression digitally and through different forms of media.  I've always been heavily inspired by music, anime like Sailor Moon and games like the Street Fighter, Tekken and Soulcalibur series. </p>
    <p>  For this class, I want to explore different ways to express myself through different forms of media.  While I am versed with some Adobe apps like Photoshop, I’ve only ever used them as tools to complete and finalize artwork and photographs, so I would love to explore different ways to use the app effectively and find new methods of making art.  I aim to improve in Illustrator as well, as I’m interested in getting more familiar with vector art, especially as a means of exploring graphic design, since I’m a bit more versed with raster illustration through programs like Clip Studio Paint.  </p>
    <p>  Ultimately, I aim to be a Character Artist for games and animation.  I hope that with the experience I gain from this class, as well as the skills I gained through traditional forms of art making, can give me a good foundation to build off of to create a good portfolio and new perspective on the creative process.</p>
    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>  This week’s assignment was my introduction to coding.  I’ve taken a web design class many years ago, but even that course never went into the intricacies of what the code looks like.  Building the html file was the easiest part, but putting together the code chain–while altogether straightforward–was definitely as nerveracking as I thought it’d be.  Trying to type paragraphs on a single straight line was a nuance, to the point where I just typed my paragraphs on a separate document and pasted them in in order to make things easier.  Once I got the sense of the chain for the title, header and body, it went rather smoothly.  The hardest part was definitely adding the picture.  I thought I had to add the photo to the code file, which didn’t work.  Then I tried adding the title of the photo to no avail.  It wasn’t until I checked the professor’s email where I understood I had to add the images file as a whole and type in the link.  I would love to get more knowledge on how to build a website in order to build my own from the ground up.</p>

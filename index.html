    <h1>Rhamsys Holoman's MEDPL 150 Portfolio</h1>
    <h2>Creative Statement</h2>
    <p>  I want to explore how to bring characters from canvas and text to the more interactive world of media.  As a studio art major, I wanted to hone and sharpen my creative expression through traditional mediums and methods, like drawing and painting, in order to better understand how to translate my creative expression digitally and through different forms of media.  I've always been heavily inspired by music, anime like Sailor Moon and games like the Street Fighter, Tekken and Soulcalibur series. </p>
    <p>  For this class, I want to explore different ways to express myself through different forms of media.  While I am versed with some Adobe apps like Photoshop, I’ve only ever used them as tools to complete and finalize artwork and photographs, so I would love to explore different ways to use the app effectively and find new methods of making art.  I aim to improve in Illustrator as well, as I’m interested in getting more familiar with vector art, especially as a means of exploring graphic design, since I’m a bit more versed with raster illustration through programs like Clip Studio Paint.  </p>
    <p>  Ultimately, I aim to be a Character Artist for games and animation.  I hope that with the experience I gain from this class, as well as the skills I gained through traditional forms of art making, can give me a good foundation to build off of to create a good portfolio and new perspective on the creative process.</p>

    <h3><p>I was first introduced to the horrors of nuclear war at a young age through the animated film Grave of the Fireflies, which graphically depicted the atomic bomb being dropped on Hiroshima and the hellish aftermath that it left.  It left a lasting effect on me, and I hoped that another nuclear war would never happen again.  You could imagine the sense of dread when I read the article to find out how many nuclear weapons are still in the world and that we're in the midst of another conflict fueled by petulance, greed and bravado.</p></h3>
    <h3><p>The site was the thing that gave the article The Brink a very sense of impending danger from the beginning, with that alarming red glow that fades in and out as you scroll.  This builds up as it leads to the article’s own illustrations displaying the destruction that a nuclear bomb brings.  Before you see the bomb go off, the red flash goes black and you see an object flash by and sink into the dark center of the screen.  You then see a flash of yellow that grows brighter and brighter until a swift flash of white ushers in the harrowing artwork filled with fire and destruction. 
The use of a more graphic artstyle helps ground you in the chaos, showing you scenes of decay and ruin as you continue to scroll.</p></h3>
    <h3><p>While you continue your descent into the article, it shows small boxes of text to guide the user through the images, giving descriptive blurbs to involve the reader’s imagery.  There is no audio or foley sounds that play as scroll, with the only audio coming from video clips of government officials like President Vladimir Putin speaking.  The article provides the images, while the text invokes the reader to use their own imagination to anchor themselves into the hellscape. </p></h3>
    <h3><p>The other graphic I briefly mentioned earlier was the map and time charts that displayed how many nuclear warheads were stockpiled in world history.  Not only did it show the total amount over time, it also showed which countries have nuclear warheads and how many each country has gained and lost since the end of World War II.  It is unfathomable that after the event of WWII, the amount of nuclear warheads ballooned from around 100 to over 60 thousand by the time the Cold War had begun.  Although that number has significantly decreased over time, there are still over 10,000 nuclear warheads in the world, with Russia having the largest stockpile.  Russia constantly threatens to start a nuclear war should other countries try to interfere with the occupation of Ukraine.  They even threatened to nuke Ukraine altogether.  The article sets out to portray the terror that is nuclear war and that another and possibly more devastating one is at stake. </p></h3>
    <h3><p>While not in this article, I think it also illustrates the dangerous effects of totalitarianism and imperialism.  While other countries like China and India have nuclear arms, Russia and the US have the most, with countries like Israel starting to stockpile only recently.  Most of the countries that have these stockpiles are either at war or constantly in fear of it.  While all war is violent and bleak, nuclear war has an extreme sense of disconnection and cowardice, and to constantly leave the world in grasp should be means enough to demand societal change on a global scale.</p></h3>

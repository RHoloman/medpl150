    <p>  For this picture, I knew I wanted to make the red exit the the point of interest.  By adjusting the ISO and the exposure, I was able to bring out the contrast in the camera itself.  The person happened to be walking by toward the sign, adding some more intrigue to the pjoto.  When I cropped the image, I cut the figure in half to add more tension to the final image.</p>

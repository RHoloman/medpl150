      <p>    This photo I wanted to capture how the buildings captured a piece of the sky, turning it into negative space.  A building cuts into the space, turning it into the focal point of the image.  You can also see the grime and dust from the window covering the skuline, and then is framed by the window pane.  I tweak the levels to bring out the contrast a bit more, as well as tweaking the curves to add a slightly blue tint.</p>

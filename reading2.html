    <h2><p> AI as a pop culture phenomenon was an inevitability.  Generating humanoid cats go through dramatic storylines in under sixty second videos or even having a generated voice over tell a made-up story about how someone got away from their toxic relationship while compiled baking or crafting videos play in the background are goldmines for easy and fast media for engagement.  This is partially due to the rise of shortform video through social media platforms like the now lost Vine and more infamously and current leading platform TikTok, with the latter being used the most for these AI slop videos. </p></h2>
    <h2><p> AI has also been integrated into other artforms within digital media.  Art platforms like Deviantart, Pinterest and Artstation have been bloated with AI generated illustrations, fashion and costume designs, as well as interior designs.  Media studios have started using AI for their shows for concepts, scripts and even editing.  The recent reboot of the Italian cartoon franchise Winx Club has been alleged to use AI for their character designs, with one having supposed evidence related to the character Aisha having a nearly one-to-one appearance to a generated image, albeit tweaked to fit the artstyle of the show.  The ethics on using AI as a starting point is still murky as it is new territory.  However, it is known that AI cannot create without “intelligence”, meaning it needs to be fed these ideas and references.  Many artists’ work have been stolen and used to feed and improve AI without their consent, making AI feel like large-scale and unchecked art theft.  </p></h2>
    <h2><p> As a means for fascism and propaganda, the writing was on the wall even before the Trump administration started using them for their social media platforms this year.  The “deepfake” video, using video editing and or AI to make a video using someone’s likeness to create a fabricated event or narrative, has been used as a tool to alter someone’s view of reality and cause division and distrust in media during recent elections.  Unlike the traditional smear ad campaigns that are just edited to skew the viewer toward the commissioning candidate, deepfakes were used to make a political candidate say or do something that they never did in reality.  These videos were rampant during the 2016 US presidential race, specifically of Democratic candidate and then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in order to cause chaos and sway the election toward the Republican candidate Donald Trump, who would end up winning the election.  </p></h2>
    <h2><p> Now the Administration uses AI slop videos and photos unabashedly on their social media platforms.  On May 4th, which is Star Wars day, the White House’s official X (formerly Twitter) account posted an artificially generated portrait of President Trump in attire inspired from the franchise along with a red lightsaber,  missing the irony that red lightsabers are often linked to villains and authoritarians throughout the different anthologies and media.  The use of AI has become increasingly more sinister though, as they have posted fake articles and news clips, as well as videos depicting violence toward migrants and fellow government officials especially or the ICE-led tirades they have issued across the nation.  </p></h2>
    <h2><p> Generative AI can do some fascinating things and is a perfect tool to explore making art media.  Nevertheless, ethics need to be put in place to keep its use and intent in check and it's being used as a tool to lessen the need for human intuition and effort in a capitalistic society.</p></h2>
